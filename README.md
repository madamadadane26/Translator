The objective of this project was to learn how to create an ASR(automatic speech recognition) system and to create a deep learning-based acoustic model for speech recognition by employing Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss.
